# snp-analysis-wes-hack

We are trying to identify SNP regions associated with the geographical locations of sterna dougallii from the Atlantic Ocean basin.

We are looking for the 1-3 individual DNA sites (SNPs) among the 100s assayed for this graph, that are driving the differentiation among these groups.
